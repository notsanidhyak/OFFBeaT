# OFFBeaT

The problem we are trying to solve: Students nowadays rely heavily on their phones or laptops to do a variety of academic and extracurricular activities, including submitting assignments, paying fees, staying current on events, attending online classes, marking their attendance and other similar tasks. Even professors and lecturers have a lot of work to do, including recording attendance, uploading study materials, taking quizzes, and even running online classrooms, as was the case in
the COVID era. Professors and teachers alike employ several applications for these tasks, which is time-consuming for the user and uses up more storage on the device. They need to use multiple apps and websites for different purposes. This is exactly gap we are trying to fill. We have made the onestop solution for all these needs – OFFBeaT App.

The idea (a brief description of our idea): Our application, The OFFBeaTapp, is a one-stop solution for all institute-related hassles because it offers a wide range of functionalities, such as student attendance marking offline attendance reports, data handling, course-related activities like receiving notices, study materials, giving quizzes, online video calling for taking online classes, and even getting updates on upcoming gymkhana events through institute specific social media module. OFFBeaT assists the teachers in freeing themselves from the burden of managing student data, including grades and attendance totals. OFFBeaT assists in lowering the number of apps a professor/students uses on a daily basis.

Competitors in the market: We have not yet discovered another application with the same functionality set as ours and which deals with the exact same problem statement . We have attempted to replace the requirement for numerous platforms (such as an attendance management software, Google Meet, Google Classroom, Instagram, email, etc.) with our onestop solution.

Business Model: We would be distributing this application at institute level mainly. Institutes will need to pay an annual subscription rate to customize the application as per their requirements. The subscription will offer the students of that institute to access all the features. Students need not pay any money. Only institute will be paying us directly through the app itself. We plan to keep the business model similar to that of “My Gate” application available in the market currently.
